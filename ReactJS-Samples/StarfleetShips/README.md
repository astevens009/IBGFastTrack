##ReactJS component demo
This is my first pass at creating and reusing a component in ReactJS. The demo includes the concepts of using state, props, events and passing functions to the component. It also includes the use of both CSS files and inline styling. Though all the components have an input box, the only editable one is the Starfleet ship with the name "Stargazer". I will learn how to edit all the components in upcoming lectures.
